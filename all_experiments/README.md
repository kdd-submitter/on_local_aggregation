Invocation commands for all experiments in the "On local aggregation in heterophilic graph"  paper. The commands are grouped by dataset. Make sure you invoke the commands in the root directory of the repository. Since some datasets are very sensitive to the splitting random seed used, we never cherry pick the best seed values, but always use consecutive seed values starting at zero, i.e, if we train using 20 random splits of the data, we use seed values {0,..,19}. To avoid cluttering the files, the invocation command for only one seed is shown.  To use other seeds, set the --split-seed command line argument to a different value.
